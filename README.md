# bikeshare-log

LA Metro launched their bikeshare program in July 2016 with 1000 bicycles at 65 stations scattered throughout DTLA.  I bought the $20 monthly pass - all trips under 30 minutes are free.  I've utilized the bikeshare far more often than I anticipated.  It affords me greater flexibility than relying soley on walking and public transit.  I now carry a helmet with me everywhere.

The Metro Bikeshare page shows your ride info, but doesn't yet provide it in a machine-readable format.  I hope they do, but in the meantime I wanted to scrape and parse the data so I can run my own analysis on my rides.
